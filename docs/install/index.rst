Install CircuitPython
=====================

Before doing anything else, you should install the latest version of CircuitPython. This ensures you have a clean build with all the latest updates. Adafruit has an excellent quick start guide `here <https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pybadge/installing-circuitpython>`_ to step you through the exact process of getting the latest build of CircuitPython for the PyBadge. Adafruit also have a more detailed comprehensive version of all the steps with complete explinations `here <https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/installing-circuitpython>`_ you can use, if this is your first time loading CircuitPython onto your device. 

Just a reminder, if you are having any problems loading CircuitPython onto your PyBadge, ensure that you are using a USB cable that not only provides power, but also provides a data link. Many USB cables you buy are only for charging, not transfering data as well. Once all loaded, come on back to continue the tutorial.
